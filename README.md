iOS.css is a set of JavaScript and CSS files, that enable web developers to make use of pixel-perfect imitations of native iOS user interface elements in web applications.

The project is growing over time, so far the following iOS UI elements have been added:

* Checkboxes
* List Views
* Black Navigation Bars
* Default Header

*Dependencies*

Depends on jQuery to select and modify DOM elements and handle events.
